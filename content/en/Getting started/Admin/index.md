  Before using the MeetingRoomMap admin site or any of the add-ins, an Azure/Office365 Tenant administrator needs to give consent.
---

The MeetingRoomMap service is being registered as an application in Azure Active Directory (AAD) and requires a few permissions in the target AAD to function.

## Grant consent as tenant administrator

**To grant consent to MeetingRoomMap, click on "Enroll your company in MeetingRoomMap" on the front page of the admin site ([https://www.meetingroommap.net](https://www.meetingroommap.net/)) or go directly to this link:</br>
[https://www.meetingroommap.net/Account/SignUp](https://www.meetingroommap.net/Account/SignUp)**

{{% alert title="To grant tenant-wide admin consent, you need:" color="secondary" %}}
An Azure account with one of the following roles: Global Administrator, Privileged Role Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, or Application Administrator. A user can also be authorized to grant tenant-wide consent if they are assigned a custom directory role that includes the permission to grant permissions to applications.

## Permissions

When granting consent the following list of delegated permissions are requested:

{{< imgproc consent Fill "433x749" >}}
{{< /imgproc >}}


{{% alert title="Delegated permissions" color="info" %}}

All permissions granted are of type 'Delegated' (and not application). All requests are thus made on behalf of the currently signed-in user and adhere to the signed-in user's privileges. The application does not have any permissions on it's own (read more here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts#delegated-and-application-permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts#delegated-and-application-permissions))

The table below indicates the usage and justification of each individual delegated permission:
