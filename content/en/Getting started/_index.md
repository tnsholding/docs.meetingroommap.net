  Setting up MeetingRoomMap and installing add-ins
---

This section describes the steps needed to start using MeetingRoomMap.

## Prerequisites
#### Microsoft Office 365

The add-ins are made for the Office 365 suite, and MeetingRoomMap registers as an application in Azure AD and expects users to log in with a valid Azure AD/Office 365 account. Meeting rooms and people to map are fetched from Azure AD. Thus an active Office 365 subscription is needed.
#### Paid subscription plan for MeetingRoomMap

Using the admin web site and add-ins of MeetingRoomMap, requires a paid subscription plan - see [https://www.meetingroommap.net/Pricing](https://www.meetingroommap.net/Pricing).
The subscription is obtained through the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/tnsconsulting.meetingroommap) and billed monthly through the Azure billing.

{{% alert title="Free trial" color="info" %}}
A free trial exists for trying out MeetingRoomMap. For a period of two weeks, the admin web site and all add-ins can be used without an active subscription.
