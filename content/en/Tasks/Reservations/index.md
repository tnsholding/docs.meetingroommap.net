Reservations are normally edited and viewed using the Reservations add-in in Teams. It's only possible to view your own reservations or those made by other team members - not the entire organization. But an administrator has the ability to view all the reservations across the organization and the possibility to delete reservations made by others.

You need to be assigned the role "ReservationsAdmin" to be able to view and delete other users reservations - see [Assign ReservationsAdmin role](/getting-started/reservations/reservationsadmin/)

To view reservations as a ReservationsAdmin go to [Admin web site -> Account -> Reservations](https://www.meetingroommap.net/reservations):
