# docs.meetingroommap.net

This is the documentation site for [MeetingRoomMap](https://www.meetingroommap.net). MeetingRoomMap is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution to visually show locations on your own floorplans. Floorplans are uploaded as images. The following types of locations can be mapped:

* Meeting rooms (automatically listed from the meeting rooms defined in Office 365)

* People (automatically listed from Azure AD)

* Custom locations (your own categories of locations, i.e. printers, desks, fire extinguisher,
defibrillators)

</br>
The MeetingRoomMap suite consists of: </br></br>

* An admin website (https://www.meetingroommap.net) to upload your own floorplan images and visually map locations to these floorplans.

* A series of Office add-ins for Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint to search and display the mapped locations.

* A reservation system for handling reservations based on visually making a reservation of mapped entities (i.e. of desks in a flexible office setup). The reservations system is integrated as an app for Microsoft Teams.
